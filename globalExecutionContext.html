 // Problem 1

// console.log(x)
// var x=10
// foo()
// function foo(){
//     console.log('Inside Foo Function')
// }
/*
Memory phase- First Var is Gone in memory phase And take value of x is undefined like var x=undefined,
then full foo function is gone in memory phase like - function foo(){
                                                       console.log('Inside Foo Function')
                                                       }
then we come to code phase - 
in code phase code runs line by line first console.log(x) output is undefined then go to second line var x = 10
and in memory phase the value of x is 10 the foo() function is called and execute the total output is 
undefined
Inside Foo Function

//Problem 2

// function first(){
//     console.log('First Function')
//     second()
// }
// function second(){
//     console.log('Second function')
//     third()
// }
// function third(){
//     console.log('third function')
// }
// first()

/*
Memory phase - All the gone to the memory phase as it is then code phase executes

code phase - the code runs line by line first call the first() function then enter in first function nd
then executes second() executes nd the third()
output - 
First Function
Second function 
third function
*/

//Problem 3
/*
Explain Global Execution context

Global Exuecution starts when Javascript code starts Executing

It have two phase 1. Memory Phase 2.Code Phase

1. Memory Phase - It is Storage Area, Where function And variables stores before Execution,
 Hoisting of variables in memory phase.
2. code phase - where code executes line by line

*/

// problem 4
/*
memory phase vs code phase
1. Memory Phase - It is Storage Area, Where function And variables stores before Execution,
 Hoisting of variables in memory phase.
2. code phase - where code executes line by line
1. Memory Phase (Creation Phase)
This happens before the actual execution of the code.
The JavaScript engine allocates memory for variables and functions.
Function declarations are hoisted and stored in memory with their full definition.
2. Code Phase (Execution Phase)
This is when the JavaScript engine actually runs the code line by line.
Variables declared with let and const get assigned values.
Function calls are executed.
The execution context keeps track of which function is currently running.

*/
 //Problem 5
 /*
 Function Execution Lifestyle

 function full expression allocates in memory phase nd executes in code phase nd 
 after the code executes it will go to dead zone in memory phase.
